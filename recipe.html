			<h2>The Negroni</h2>
		</div>
		<section class="text1">
			<p><strong>The Negroni</strong> is one of the O.G. cocktails. While it's extremely simple to make, the flavours are anything but. A bitter punch from the Campari is tempered by sweeth vermouth, and the addition of gin makes this a cocktail that is to not be taken lightly. While the proportions are sacrosanct, variation abounds with an array of vermouths and gins to try in search of finding the perfect combination. I like a London dry gin with Cocchi's Vermouth di Torino.</p>

					<h4><em>Trivia</em></h4>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.drinkingcup.net/the-real-count-camillo-negroni/">Legend has it</a> that the Negroni came into existence in 1912, when Count Camillo Negroni, having gained a taste for stronger drinks during his American travels, asked his bartender to beef up his Americano (Campari, vermouth, and soda water) by replacing the water with gin.</li>
						<li>Don't like gin? Switch it for bourbon and you have a Boulevardier.</li>
						<li>Up until 2006, Campari was got its distinctive colour from dye derived from the cochineal insect.</li>

				<h3>Directions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Before you start making the drink, chill the rocks glass that you'll be serving it in. (You could serve the drink <em>up</em> if you wanted to, but I prefer on the rocks.) Chilling the glass ensures that the cocktail will stay colder longer, and that's important for a boozy cocktail like the Negroni. If you don't have one chilling in the fridge, simple fill a glass with ice and water. The water will maximize surface area of the glass that gets exposed to the cold, leading to a more efficient process.</li>
					<li>As the glass chills, you can start making your cocktail. Measure out an ounce of each spirit and pour it into a mixing glass. Then, put a good amount of ice in the mixing glass (enough so that it is above the level of the liquid). Stir the cocktail with a bar spoon for about ten seconds, or until the glass is quite cold to the touch.</li>
					<li>When you're done stirring the drink, go back to the glass you have chilling. Dump out the ice and water and replace with fresh ice. I like to use one big cube, as it melts slower and won't adjust the dilution of the drink too much.</li>
					<li>Strain the mixed drink into the glass and garnish with an orange twist (not a slice!).</li>
